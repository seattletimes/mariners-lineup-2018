    "prediction": "He has been remarkably consistent in his four years as a major-leaguer, with batting averages between .285 and .288 and on-base percentages between .349 and .356. So expect more of the same.",

    "best": "He improves on the decent offensive numbers he put up for a half-season as a rookie last year, and the Mariners finally have a shortstop they can count on for years to come.",
    "worst": "He regresses offensively in his second season, just like other Mariners middle-infield prospects over the past few years (Dustin Ackley, Nick Franklin and Brad Miller), and struggles at the plate affect his defense.",
    "prediction": "With such a small sample size from last year, it’s tough to predict. But here’s guessing he will hit about .250 with 15 stolen bases, which will be enough to keep his job provided he plays good defense.",

    "worst": "His offensive numbers continue to decline, the baserunning blunders from last year return, and that 10-year, $240 million deal he signed looks to be just another disaster from GM Jack Zduriencik’s tenure.",
    "prediction": "A season about as good as last year. At 33, he certainly should have a few good years left, but it’s likely he will never be as productive as he was during his best years with the Yankees.",

    "worst": "The inevitable drop-off (he turns 36 in in July) begins, and the power numbers take a big plunge, along with his batting average.",
    "prediction": "He will have a good season, with about 30 homers, a .270 batting average and 90 RBI. Anything more would be remarkable for a player who has had his best season in his mid-30s.",

    "prediction": "He has been fairly consistent throughout his career, so expect him to hit about .250 with 12 home runs. That would be enough to keep him in the platoon role.",
